# kynx/laminas-dkim

[laminas-mail] DKIM Signer.

This is a drop in replacement for [metalinspired/laminas-dkim], which the code is entirely based on. I've added unit 
tests and bug fixes to this branch. The original package was forked from [joepsyko/zf-dkim], which in turn was forked
from [fastnloud/zf-dkim].

If you are looking for PHP8+ support, more improvements, or would like to contribute, please try the 2.x branch.

## Installation

```
composer require kynx/laminas-dkim
```

If you are adding this to an existing Laminas or Mezzio project, you should be prompted to add the package as a module 
/ to your config. 

Next copy the configuration to your autoload directory:

```
cp vendor/kynx/laminas-dkim/dkim.local.php.dist config/autoload/dkim.local.php
```

This file will contain the private key used to sign messages: **do not** check it into version control!

Now create a private signing key, as described at [dkimcore.org], and add it to the configuration file you copied above, 
_without_ the surrounding `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` / `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`. 

Finish the configuration by setting your domain, selector and the headers you want to sign in the configuration file.

You should now be able to sign messages. But you still will need to configure your DNS `TXT` record before receiving 
mail servers will be able to verify it: see [dkimcore.org] for more instructions.

## Usage

```php
<?php 

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$container = require 'config/container.php';

$mail = new \Laminas\Mail\Message();
$mail->setBody("Hello world!");
$mail->setFrom('from@example.com');
$mail->addTo('to@example.com');
$mail->setSubject('subject');

// Sign message with dkim
$signer = $container->get(\Dkim\Signer\Signer::class);
$signer->signMessage($mail);

// Send message
$transport = new \Laminas\Mail\Transport\Sendmail();
$transport->send($mail);
```
